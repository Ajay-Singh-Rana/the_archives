# The Bird Species Found In And Around Titakot

This is a rough work and it includes not only the birds seen
year around but also the migratory birds which fly the local skies seasonally.
I am not an ornithologist and therefore this list might not be precise and 
may have some discrepancies (hence the term rough work). I will try to include
whatever information I can gather from the locals and the internet.

*Note : The bird calls and pictures are recorded and captured by me i.e. **h3avren***
