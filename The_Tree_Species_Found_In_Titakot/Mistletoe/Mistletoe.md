# Mistletoe
It is a parasitic plant which germinates on tree branches and weakens them.
This parasite can be easily sighted on various trees of varying species and 
sizes, as its leafs are different from the host tree. And in winters when most
trees shed their leaves it can be seen as a green patch on the tree as it
does not need to shed leaves in order to minimize energy uses in harsh winters
cause it derives all its energy from the host plant.
It grows a haustorium on the infested branch and starts growing root like
suckers which penetrate the branch and grow inwards until it reaches the 
conductive tissue of the tree.
Mistletoe are called hemi-parasitic as in the beginning when the haustorium
has not infested the branch the Mistletoe carries out photosyntesis on its
own. But, once the infestation is complete its contribution to its nutrition
by carrying out its own photosynthesis becomes insignificant.
The branches which are infested bulge out and the tree can be saved by pruning
such branches otherwise the Mistletoe might take over the whole tree and 
kill it. Just cutting its branches does not gaurantee its complete removal.
If even a small part of the haustorium remains attached the Mistletoe might
regrow.
Note: The Mistletoe seeds are covered by a liquid that is highly viscous 
and could therfore be for protective purposes so that the seeds cannot be 
easily digested by birds. Given birds poop is a propagator of Mistletoe.
