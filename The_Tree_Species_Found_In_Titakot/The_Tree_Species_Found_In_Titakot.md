# The Tree Species Found In And Around Titakot

This is a rough work and it includes not only the trees but also bushes;
that is herbs and shrubs. I will list fruits and flowers separately. It may
not be precise (the reason I acclaim this to be rough work) as I am not a
specialist when it comes to plants but I will try to mention whatever 
information I can gather from my elders and the internet.
